Those who are closest to me know how passionate I am about health and data. But funnily enough, 5 years ago I had no idea that bioinformatics lay on this fascinating intersection. I just wanted to find a way to use my scientific curiosity to help people in need. After doing a bioinformatics internship during my bachelorâ€™s I realised that this field was the way to turn my calling into a profession.

I'm currently working as a Bioinformatics Scientist at SkylineDx, where I use machine learning and statistics to unlock clinical insights from biological data. Previously, I studied Computer Science and Bioinformatics at TU Delft and The University of Edinburgh (MSc), after doing a Bachelor's in Bioengineering in Tecnico Lisboa. 

While I spend a lot of time coding (and cleaning data!), I have other interests as well. For example, I love dancing and I've tried almost every kind of dance, from ballet to hip hop. But now I dance mostly bachata. I also enjoy a lot activities that make me leave my bubble and show me how beautiful and rich this world is. That's why I try to travel as much as I can and enjoy a lot meeting people from other cultures, learning new languages or going to museums.

In the end, this blog is the reflection of this person. Someone who loves what she does and wants to share her passions with the world as well.

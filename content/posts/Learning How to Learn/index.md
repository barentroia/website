**Description:** [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) (LHL)  is a free course offered by Coursera and one of the most popular courses there. In LHL, Dr. Barbara Oakley explains how humans learn and what habits help us learn more effectively. The course is suited for everyone, from students to retired people, and no background is needed. It takes only 4 weeks to complete, with a workload of about 2 hours per week. 

**My opinion:** Some years ago, I came across this course in Coursera. It seemed interesting, but I was following so many university courses at the time that I ended up leaving this course aside. Big mistake. Although I’ve always been a good student, understanding the science behind how we learn could have made my study sessions even more effective and help me better remember what I learnt. 

There were many aspects I liked about the course. Above all, I found the length of the course perfect and it was easy to follow while working full-time. Lecturers were engaging and the material was well explained. I also liked that the course covers many topics related to learning. While some are more suited for people who are studying full-time, I found that almost all of the videos had something that I could apply to improve my learning in the future. Namely, at the beginning of the course I wanted to better understand how we could make our learnings more lasting and how we could keep being creative as we specialize in some technical fields. I feel that now I'm much more able to answer these questions even if only a few videos specifically address these questions. In the end, the only disappointing aspect for me was that very few videos were focused on how the brain works when it is learning. I understand that this would make the course less suited for a less technical audience, but for me this could have enriched the course.

It’s quite remarkable that we spend more than 10 years learning things at school/university, yet we might have never really learnt how to learn. I wish I had taken this course a bit sooner in my life, but at least I'm glad that I did it now. I have already started changing some of my learning habits and I definitely see an improvement on what I am now able to learn in less time.

**Veredict:** I recommend this course to everyone. I do find it a pity that this content is not covered in schools and I will do my best to teach some of its lessons to others.
